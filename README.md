Certainly, here's an example of an excellent, compelling README file for the go-exchange project:

# go-exchange (GEX)

go-exchange is a Go package that provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for interacting with cryptocurrency exchanges. The package supports a wide range of exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and more.

## Features

- Simple and easy-to-use API for interacting with cryptocurrency exchanges

## Installation

To install go-exchange, simply run:

```
go get github.com/irononet/go-exchange
```

## Getting started

To get started with go-exchange, you'll need to create an API key for your exchange account. Once you have your API key, you can create a new exchange object and start making API calls:

```go
import (
    "github.com/irononet/go-exchange"
)

// Create a new exchange object
exchange := exchange.NewExchange("binance", "API_KEY", "SECRET_KEY")

// Get the current price of Bitcoin in USD
price, err := exchange.GetPrice("BTC/USD")
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

// Print the current price of Bitcoin
fmt.Printf("Current Bitcoin price: %f USD\n", price)
```

## Documentation

The go-exchange package is well-documented and provides detailed API documentation and examples for each supported exchange. You can view the documentation on the [official go-exchange website](https://irononet.github.io/go-exchange/).
